An AI-powered Fan Fiction Writing Assistant.

Ficbot is a machine learning-based system that provides various tools to make a good starting point for an aspiring writer when they need a character, but don't know where to start.

Here you will find the source code for my **Flask-based web client** for the main application. You can find out more about the main project in **this [repository](https://github.com/Pythonimous/ficbot)**, and **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset/37798ba55fed88400b584cd0df4e784317eb7a6708e02fd5a650559fb4598353)** - about the dataset.
